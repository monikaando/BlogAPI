## Setup
To run the application: npm start after installing node modules (npm i)
## Name
Social Brothers Blog API

## General info
    1) I made the application according to instructions and the example image from Social Brothers.
    2) The whole application is responsive.
    3) I took care to keep the code is clean and readable.
    4) For images I used Claudinary.
    5) For styling I used Sass(I could use Bootstrap or Bulma (like in my previous projects), 
    but I wanted to show that I know how CSS, Sass and responsivity works.)
    
## Content

## Header
    1) The header image is from the www.werkenbijsocialbrothers.nl. I put it on my Cloudinary account. 
    I played with the code to achieve the expected result without cropping the image.
    2) I put a darker filter on the picture.
    3) I changed the logo color (from gray/orange to white/orange) in a graphic program (according to 
    the example image).
    4) I added a favicon and the title for the website.
    
## Form
    1) I created form to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors,
    fonts, the same arrow in select option)
    2) It is possible to extend a text area of "Bericht" vertically.
    3) I added extra frame (orange frame appears when the field is clicked)
    4) Form is sending data to the server through the API
    5) I put a popup window after submitting a form. It is informing the user that data was send.
    
## Blogposts list
    1) I created posts to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts)
    2) I show data and type of category on the image (even if category or category name is empty in the database)
    3) With the first contact with the application we can see on the list only 4 blog posts from the first page.
    4) "Meer laden" button:
        - after the first click we can see those 6 blog posts missing from the first page (on every page we have 10 blog posts),
        - every another click shows all post from the next pages. 
        
## Footer
    An additional element with the link to my github page (not visible on pictures below)
