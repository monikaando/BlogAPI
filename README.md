To run the application: npm start after installing node modules (npm i)

* Application
    1. I made the application according to instructions and the example image from Social Brothers.
    2. The whole application is responsive.
    3. I made code clean and readable.
    4. I used Cloudinary for images.
    5. I used Sass for styling (I could use Bootstrap or Bulma (like in my previous projects), but I wanted to show that I know how CSS, Sass and responsivity works.)
---------
* Header
    1. I took the header image from the www.werkenbijsocialbrothers.nl and I put it on my Cloudinary account. I played with the code to achieve the expected result without cropping the image.
    2. I put a darker filter on the picture.
    3. I changed the logo color (from gray/orange to white/orange) in a graphic program (according to the example image).
    4. I added a favicon and the title for the website.
* Form
    1. I created form to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts, the same arrow in select option)
    2. It is possible to extend a text area of "Bericht" vertically.
    3. I added extra frame (orange frame appears when the field is clicked)
    4. Form is sending data to the server through the API
    5. I put a popup window after submitting a form. It is informing the user that data was send.
* Blogposts list
    1. I created posts to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts)
    2. With the first contact with the application we can see only 4 blog posts on the list.
    3. "Meer laden" button:
        a. after the first click we can see those 6 blog posts missing from the first page (on every page we have 10 blog posts),
        b. every another click shows all post from the next pages. 
* Footer
    Additional element with link to my github page
