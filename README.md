To run the application: npm start after installing node modules (npm i)<

- Application<br>
    1) I made the application according to instructions and the example image from Social Brothers.<br>
    2) The whole application is responsive.<br>
    3) I made code clean and readable.<br>
    4) I used Cloudinary for images.<br>
    5) I used Sass for styling (I could use Bootstrap or Bulma (like in my previous projects), but I wanted to show that I know how CSS, Sass and responsivity works.)<br>

- Header<br>
    1) I took the header image from the www.werkenbijsocialbrothers.nl and I put it on my Cloudinary account. I played with the code to achieve the expected result without cropping the image.<br>
    2) I put a darker filter on the picture.<br>
    3) I changed the logo color (from gray/orange to white/orange) in a graphic program (according to the example image).<br>
    4) I added a favicon and the title for the website.<br>
    
- Form<br>
    1) I created form to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts, the same arrow in select option)<br>
    2) It is possible to extend a text area of "Bericht" vertically.<br>
    3) I added extra frame (orange frame appears when the field is clicked)<br>
    4) Form is sending data to the server through the API<br>
    5) I put a popup window after submitting a form. It is informing the user that data was send.<br>
- Blogposts list<br>
    1) I created posts to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts)<br>
    2) I show data and type of category on the image (even if category or category name is empty in the database)<br>
    3) With the first contact with the application we can see only 4 blog posts on the list.<br>
    4) "Meer laden" button:<br>
        a. after the first click we can see those 6 blog posts missing from the first page (on every page we have 10 blog posts),<br>
        b. every another click shows all post from the next pages. <br>
- Footer<br>
    Additional element with the link to my github page<br>
