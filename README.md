To run an application, install: npm i in a folder and after type: npm start in a terminal

According to instructions an the image with layout o the page, I took the following steps:
* Header
    1. I took header image from the www.werkenbijsocialbrothers.nl website and I adjusted it without cropping it. I could crop this in a graphic program, but I wanted to challenge myself and work on full dimensions image and make it responsive.
    2. I put a darker filter on the picture.
    3. I changed logo color (from gray/orange to white/orange) in a graphic program.
    4. I added a favicon ant the title of the website.
* Form
    1. I created form to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts, the same arrow in select option)
    2. It is possible to extend a text area of "Bericht" vertically.
    3. I added extra frame (orange frame appears when the field is clicked)
    4. The whole form is responsive.
    5. Form is sending data to the server through the API
    5. Pop after submitting a form informing that data was send.
* Blogposts list
    1. I created posts to look as similar as possible according to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts)
    2. 
* Footer
    Additional element with link to my github page

Application is made by instructions and image from Social Brothers
Application is responsive.
I made code clean and readable
I used cloudinary for some images.
I used Sass for styling.
I could use Bootstrap or Bulma, but I want to show that I know how exactly CSS and responsivity works.
