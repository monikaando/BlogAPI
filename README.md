To run an application, install: npm i in a folder and after type: npm start in a terminal

According to instructions an the image with layout o the page, I took the following steps:
* Header
    1. I took header image from the www.werkenbijsocialbrothers.nl website and I adjusted it without cropping it. I could crop this in a graphic program, but I wanted to work on full demention image and make bottom of the image available for smaller screens (and hide it for bigger screens). 
    2. I put a darker filter on the picture.
    3. I changed logo color (from gray/orange to white/orange) in a graphic program.
    4. I added a favicon.
* Form
    1. I created form to look as similar as possible accordint to the example image (dimentions, colors, fonts)
    2. I added extra frame (orange frame when the field is clicked)
    3. The whole form is responsive and it is changing its dimentions according to the width of the screen
    4. Form is sending data
* Articles
* Footer
    Additional element with link to my github page
