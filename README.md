To run an application, type: npm start in a terminal

According to an example imagine I took the following steps:
* Header
    1. I took header image from the www.werkenbijsocialbrothers.nl website and I adjusted it without cropping it. I could crop this in a graphic program, but I wanted to work on full demention image and make bottom of the image available for smaller screens (and hide it for bigger screens). 
    2. I put a darker filter on the picture.
    3. I changed logo color (from gray/orange to white/orange) in a graphic program.
    4. I added a favicon.
* Form
